A makefile is a file (usually named "makefile" or "Makefile" - I usually use the latter) that typically includes a list of entries, each of which has a target, list of dependencies, and a rule for creating the target from the dependencies. The simplest way to set up a makefile involves giving each step in the compilation as a separate entry in the makefile, like this:
wherewhen.o : wherewhen.c wherewhen.h
	g++ -Wall -g -c wherewhen.c

countdown.o : countdown.c countdown.h
	g++ -Wall -g -c countdown.c

main.o : main.c wherewhen.h countdown.h
	g++ -Wall -g -c main.c

myprogram : main.o countdown.o wherewhen.o
	g++ -g wherewhen.o countdown.o main.o -lm -o myprogram
